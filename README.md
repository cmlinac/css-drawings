# css-drawings

Let's face it, styling a page to get it pixel-for-pixel perfect is a pain. I have a good CSS foundation but, since I was primarily on the backend for the beginning of my career, I could use some practice. I'm going to create some drawings using only CSS. The goal here isn't to make designer-quality CSS sprites, it's to brush up on CSS and hopefully learn a thing or two along the way.
